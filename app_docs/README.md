## Description

The Threat Intelligence Detections Enrichment app is a no-code sample application built on CrowdStrike's Foundry platform. It demonstrates how developers can enhance Falcon's endpoint detection capabilities by integrating additional threat intelligence data directly into the user interface.

### Features

- Integrates data from two Falcon API endpoints:
  - Malware API
  - Indicators of Compromise (IOC) API
- Adds a custom widget to the endpoint detections screen
- Provides enriched threat intelligence without requiring users to navigate away
- Built entirely using no-code capabilities in Foundry
